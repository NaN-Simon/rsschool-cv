## Briefly About Myself:

I started studing programming at 23 years old (now I'm 25) and stopped six months later. It was Java. It was difficult for me, because I didn't see the result of my work. 

Now, I understood, that front-end development suits me and I like it.

I've always loved the video games, and in the future I would like to develop video games.
